# Rendering for SEO via UI 
The [UI scheduler](https://sigmaapi.com/settings/seo_rendering/) is easier to use. All you need to do is add a link to your sitemap and set the rendering frequency.
After that, we’ll automatically crawl each page from your sitemap on schedule and prepare an archive with the rendered files.
You just need to download this archive, upload it to your website, and configure Nginx.

**With the UI, you can:**

1. Add your sitemap.xml 
2. Set a schedule for rendering pages based on your sitemap 
3. Control the rendering delay for each page 
4. Monitor rendering status in real time 
5. Download ready-made ZIP archives with rendered static files 
6. In addition, the UI allows you to manage your API key and control your usage limits.
