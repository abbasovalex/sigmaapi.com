# Web Scraping

Sigma API helps you parse complex JavaScript-heavy websites — no headaches, no proxies.
Rendering and protection bypass are built-in! You will receive the source code of any website in html format.

<p class="warn">Sigma API does not extract specific elements from DOM — it returns the full page DOM. You're expected to parse the data you need from the DOM yourself.</p>
