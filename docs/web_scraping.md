# Web Scraping

Sigma API helps you parse complex JavaScript-heavy websites — no headaches, no proxies.
Rendering and protection bypass are built-in! You will receive the source code of any website in html format.

*Note:* Sigma API does not extract specific elements — it returns the full page DOM. You're expected to parse the data you need from the DOM yourself.

#### How to use?
- Try our [online API Console](https://console.sigmaapi.com/api/v1/).
- You can use our API endpoints from your code and IDE. See [Usage API section](/usage_examples).
